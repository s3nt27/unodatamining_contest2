Please set a working directory first. An appropriate file tree structure is needed so that {wd}/data/train.csv can be accessible.
Keep a source file named convertToRGBImage.R in the same directory to get the functions.
For a training and validation set approach, run main_cnn_svd_v6.R.
Run MATLAB files to get an understanding of different methods (if you have a GPU): such as, R-CNN, ZCA, etc.
